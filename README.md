## Lockdown notice

Dear all,

Since the school is on lockdown, we are going to change the way our course proceeds. 

1. Right now I’m in the process of recording videos for the stuff that we were going to talk about. I also recorded the last class for those of you who could not attend. There are links here to those videos, please check them out.
2. To receive credit, you need to make a presentation in groups. Nothing’s changed here, you have topics chosen. You can do it in three ways. You can record a screencast similar to my videos and send it via email/youtube link. Else, you can prepare powerpoint slides with speaker notes attached. Finally, you can write an essay (about 2-3 pages) instead of a presentation. The choice is yours.
3. If the lockdown is extended, the final deadline for your presentations would be April 14th. 
4. Since you are to do this task in groups, I encourage you to work remotely (via communicators, chats, online docs etc). The best way to minimise COVID-19 threat is through social distancing. Don’t meet in groups unless you can avoid it. 
5. Remember that you can ask me for materials for your presentation. Not everybody did so. In the off chance that you asked and did not get a reply, please ask again:) I’m getting tons of email every day, sometimes these things slip.
6. If there are any questions, don’t hesitate to ask me.

Stay safe and don’t get sick,
KB
